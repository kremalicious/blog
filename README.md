## 🎉 Features

The whole [blog](https://kremalicious.com) is a statically exported site built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and TypeScript. Almost all components are Astro or native Web Components, with some React components loaded client-side.

Styling happens through a combination of basic global styles and on components level either through CSS modules or CSS in `<style>` tags within Astro components.

Content lives under `content/` and Astro creates a content collection for each subfolder, which are then queried in components. Every post is a folder with a markdown file and all respective post assets co-located inside.

Retrieving content collections will enrich every post's frontmatter metadata, like extracting date and slug from the post folder name, or exif extraction for photos.

### 🌅 Image handling

Uses Astro's native `astro:assets` feature, all required image sizes are automatically generated from source images, working in combination with my own custom `<picture>` component. Making heavy use of Astro's `getImage()` and custom markup results in full image sizing control and properly `object-fit` images with varying aspect ratios.

Astro's sharp-based image service is extended as a custom image service to keep all image metadata intact when doing sharp transforms, making use of the [`keepMetadata`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-output/#keepmetadata) output option.

Teaser images are all defined in a post's frontmatter `image` key, which is then passed to the `<Picture />` component for display.

If you want to know how this works, have a look at the respective files:

- [`src/components/Picture/index.astro`](src/components/Picture/index.astro)
- [`src/components/Picture/index.module.css`](src/components/Picture/index.module.css)
- [`src/lib/astro/imageService.ts`](src/lib/astro/imageService.ts)

### 🎆 EXIF extraction

Automatically extracts EXIF & IPTC & GPS metadata from my photos and adds it to markdown frontmatter of respective photo posts during build time. Utilizing [exifr](https://github.com/MikeKovarik/exifr) to extract all image metadata.

In the end looks like this, including location display with [pigeon-maps](https://github.com/mariusandra/pigeon-maps):

If you want to know how this works, have a look at the respective files:

- EXIF extraction with `readImageMetadata()` helper in [`src/lib/exif/readImageMetadata.ts`](src/lib/exif/readImageMetadata.ts)
- the `loadAndFormatCollection()` helper in [`src/lib/astro/loadAndFormatCollection.ts`](src/lib/astro/loadAndFormatCollection.ts)
- output through [`src/components/Exif/`](src/components/Exif/)

### 💰 Cryptocurrency donation via Web3 browser wallets

Lets visitors say thanks with Ether, any ERC-20, or Bitcoin. The Web3 wallet integration uses [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com) for wallet connection, my own custom web3 API to fetch wallet token balances and metadata, and [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) for sending transactions.

If you want to know how this works, have a look at the respective feature under

- [`src/features/Web3/`](src/features/Web3/)

### 🔍 Search

A global search is provided with fuse.js. Whenever search is opened, all posts metadata is fetched, which is then queried against when the search field is used. This prevents a huge search index from being bundled in the site build.

If you want to know how this works, have a look at the respective feature under

- [`src/features/Search/`](src/features/Search/)

### 🕸 Related Posts

Under each post a list of related posts is displayed which are based on the tags and other metadata of the currently viewed post, also done with fuse.js.

<img width="700" alt="screen shot 2018-10-11 at 21 03 03" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90316/46827531-14f39c00-cd99-11e8-84aa-0e851c32c89c.png" />

If you want to know how this works, have a look at the respective component under

- [`src/components/RelatedPosts/`](src/components/RelatedPosts/)

### 📝 GitHub Changelog Rendering

Adds ability to show contents of a changelog, rendered from a `CHANGELOG.md` on GitHub from the given repository. The use case is to enhance release posts about projects hosted on GitHub. Makes use of the GitHub GraphQL API.

Adding this to a post's YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
changelog: kremalicious/gatsby-plugin-matomo
```

will render this at the end of the post:

<img width="700" alt="screen shot 2018-11-21 at 23 03 38" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90316/48870593-bc74dd00-ede1-11e8-9051-df55ab7b48d1.png">

See it live e.g. on [Matomo plugin for Gatsby](https://kremalicious.com/gatsby-plugin-matomo#changelog).

If you want to know how this works, have a look at the respective component under

- [`src/components/Changelog/`](src/components/Changelog/)
- the `getRepo()` helper in [`src/lib/github/github.ts`](src/lib/github/github.ts)

### 🌗 Theme Switcher

Includes a theme switcher which allows user to toggle between a light and a dark theme. Switching between them also happens automatically based on user's system preferences.

If you want to know how, have a look at the respective components:

- [`src/components/ThemeSwitch/`](src/components/ThemeSwitch/)

### 💎 SVG assets as components

Within all Astro files, SVGs can be imported as components with Astro's [native support for SVG components](https://docs.astro.build/en/components/images/#importing-svgs).

All SVG assets under `src/images/` and from select iconset dependencies are converted to React components before building the site. Compiled components are placed under `src/images/components/` and all include the cleaned SVGs as inline HTML. All SVGs can then be imported from `@/images/components` in all React components.

If you want to know how this works, have a look at the script:

- [`scripts/create-icons/`](scripts/create-icons/)

### astro-redirect-from

Still a remnant of the old [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) days, which survived in [gatsby-redirect-from](https://kremalicious.com/gatsby-redirect-from/) and now works in Astro with [astro-redirect-from](https://kremalicious.com/astro-redirect-from/).

For all post slugs defined in a `redirect_from` frontmatter key, redirects will be put in place by Astro.

### RSS & JSON feeds

Generates rss & json feeds upon build time.

If you want to know how this works, have a look at the respective files:

- [`src/pages/feed.json.ts`](src/pages/feed.json.ts)
- [`src/pages/feed.xml.ts`](src/pages/feed.xml.ts)

## ✨ Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kremalicious/blog.git
cd blog/

# required env vars
cp .env.sample .env
vi .env

# exiftool required, for macOS
brew install exiftool

npm i
bun run dev
```

### 🔮 Linting

[Biome](https://biomejs.dev) is setup for all linting and formatting purposes:

```bash
bun run lint
```

### 🔮 Type Checking

Type checking can be invoked to check all TypeScript code, including within .astro files:

```bash
bun run typecheck
```

### 👩‍🔬 Testing

Test suite is setup with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev), [react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library), and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev).

All unit test files live beside the respective component with naming pattern `*.test.ts(x)`. Integration test files live under `./test/e2e/` exclusively, with naming pattern `*.spec.ts`.

Testing setup, fixtures, and mocks shared between unit & integration tests can be found in `./test` folder.

To run all unit tests:

```bash
bun run test:unit

# watch mode
bun run test:unit:watch
```

For End-to-End integration testing, ideally run against the production build:

```bash
bun run build && bun run preview

# mapping `playwright` command
bun run test:e2e
bun run test:e2e -- --ui
bun run test:e2e -- path/to/file.spec.ts.
bun run test:e2e -- --update-snapshots
```

## 🎈 Content creation helpers

### Add a new post

```bash
bun run new "Hello World"
bun run new "Hello World" 2017-12-27
```

Create a new photo post with date, title & description pre-filled from EXIF/IPTC data of a given image file:

```bash
bun run new photo /path/to/photo.jpg
bun run new photo /path/to/photo.jpg "Hello Photo Post"
```

You can also create multiple photo posts at once by providing multiple photo paths:

```bash
bun run new photo /path/to/photo1.jpg /path/to/photo2.jpg /path/to/photo3.jpg
bun run new photo /path/to/photo1.jpg /path/to/photo2.jpg "Shared Title For Photos"
```

- [`scripts/new/`](scripts/new/)

## 🚚 Deployment

Every branch or Pull Request is automatically deployed by [Vercel](https://vercel.com) with their GitHub integration. A link to a preview deployment will appear under each Pull Request. Vercel is not used for the production deployment.

### S3 Deployment

The latest deployment of the `main` branch is automatically deployed to S3 from the GitHub Action as the production deployment, aliased to `kremalicious.com`. The deploy command simply calls the [`scripts/deploy-s3.sh`](scripts/deploy-s3.sh) script, syncing the contents of the `dist/` folder to S3:

```bash
bun run deploy:s3
```
