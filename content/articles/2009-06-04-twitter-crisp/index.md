Here's a quick twitter icon for use on your websites which is kind of a by-product from one of my last projects. But I would consider it a waste to just bury this deep in my filesystem so I think it's best I'm throwing this out to you.

This icon comes in various formats (PNG, ICNS, iContainer) and in 4 different sizes (128px, 48px, 32px, 16px) with each icon size redrawn (of course).

Use them on any web project you like and/or [convert them into a send to twitter link](http://kremalicious.com/ultimate-coda-wordpress-share-link-bonanza/). Have fun!
