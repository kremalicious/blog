With the release of Aperture 2.1 Apple introduced a plugin architecture for adding third party image adjustment and export plugins. Now the first third party image adjustment plugins for Aperture 2.1 have arrived.

And they can definitely make you stop roundtripping your pictures to Photoshop and back. For now a total of 14 plugins from 9 companys were announced which are waiting to help you with your Aperture 2 workflow.

## Dfx digital filters plugin from Tiffen

The first one is the [Dfx digital filters plug-in from Tiffen](http://www.tiffen.com/products.html?tablename=dfx) which was already available as an image editing plugin for Photoshop on Windows and Mac. It's an award winning set of [94 individual filters](http://www.tiffen.com/dfx_filter_effects_ig.html) for adjusting and altering your images in Aperture 2.1 and above.

Tiffen made the plugin available in May 2008. You can download a [free 15-day trial](http://www.tiffen.com/dfx_downloads.html) too or you can purchase it from the Tiffen-website for US\$299. Also don't forget to have a look [at the user guide](http://www.tiffen.com/userimages/Dfx-v1-Photo-UserGuide.pdf) for this plugin.

A nice in-depth overview of this plugin [gives Dominique James over at Aperture Users Professional Network](http://www.apertureprofessional.com/showthread.php?t=15225).

## Digital Film Tools Aperture Plugins

Digital Film Tools [released three plugins](http://www.digitalfilmtools.com/apertureprods.htm) for Aperture 2.1 and above which were also already available for Photoshop:

[Power Stroke 1.0](http://www.digitalfilmtools.com/powerstroke/index.htm) is an image editing plugin for making targeted adjustments by intuitive handling with strokes. You can make multiple corrections and effects with one stroke such as color correction, recoloring or desaturation, colorization of black and white images, blur, fill light for dimly lit image areas and Diffusion/Glow.

[Light! 3.5](http://www.digitalfilmtools.com/light/) is a plugin for adding Light effects with defined patterns which are created by Gamproducts.

[Ozone 2.5](http://www.digitalfilmtools.com/ozone/) is an adjustment plugin for selective adjustments of colors. It' based on the Digital Zone System, which divides a picture into 11 discrete zones where you can adjust each zone separately.

![Ozone 2.5](./dft-ozone_ui.jpg)

All plugins are available now and can be [purchased fom the Digital Film Tools website](http://www.digitalfilmtools.com/buy/home.php?cat=38) as a Super Bundle with all three plugins included for US$ 175 or separately for US$ 50 (Light and Ozone) or US\$ 120 (Power Stroke).
