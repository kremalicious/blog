I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be joining the wonderful Berlin based startup [ezeep](http://ezeep.com) as their new designer. I already had the chance to work with some very talented folks from the ezeep team and I can't wait to see what awesome stuff we'll come up with together.

This means I'm transitioning from solo freelancing & contract work to full time employment within a team. No bureaucracy, no invoicing, no joggling with many projects at the same time and no pyjama work dress anymore. Just pure design. And there's this concept of so called weekends, where I'm not supposed to work. Crazy stuff.
