Panoramic photographer [Ian Wood](http://www.ianjameswood.co.uk/) has released an automation helper for Apple's Aperture called [Aperture Assistant](http://aperture-assistant.com) as a first beta version (build 49).

Aperture Assistent allows you to setup and automate complex tasks for Apple's Aperture beyond the Apple delivered Automator actions in Mac OS X. The setup of these workflows is as easy as dragging around visual flowcharts.

Although the interface looks and feels a bit buggy (dude, it's a beta!) it looks very promising.

[You can download it from the programs website](http://aperture-assistant.com/medias). The beta version will expire on 15th May 2008 but a new beta should be available before that says Ian Wood. While Mac OS X 10.5.2 and Aperture 2.1 are the recommended system requirements Aperture Assistant also works with Mac OS X 10.4 and/or Aperture 1.5.6 and above.
