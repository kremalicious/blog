The creator of Comic Sans, Vincent Connare, [revealing the irony of it](http://www.connare.com/whycomic.htm):

> Comic Sans was NOT designed as a typeface but as a solution to a problem with the often overlooked part of a computer program's interface, the typeface used to communicate the message.
> There was no intention to include the font in other applications other than those designed for children when I designed Comic Sans. The inspiration came at the shock of seeing Times New Roman used in an inappropriate way.
