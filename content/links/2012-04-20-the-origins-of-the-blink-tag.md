Funny story from [Lou Montulli](http://www.montulli.org/lou), who is the credited inventor of the <blink> tag. As suspected of generations of web designers, it involved a bar and much alcohol:

> It turns out that one of the engineers liked my idea so much that he left the bar sometime past midnight, returned to the office and implemented the blink tag overnight. He was still there in the morning and quite proud of it.
