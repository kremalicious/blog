Great middle ground arguments from Jason Mark in this recent controversy about mobile web experiences:

> The truth is when working on mobile you should always look at the site analytics and make smart decisions based on what you find. If you find that your mobile users use the site in a significantly different way than desktop users, check out Nielsen's guidelines and see which apply to you. And if you find that your mobile users are accessing the same content as desktop users then consider a responsive design.
