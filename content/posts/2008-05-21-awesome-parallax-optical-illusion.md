![Parallax](../media/parallax_illusion_css.png)As you may know there's a nice parallax effect implemented on this website. Just resize your browser window and you can see the black polaroids in my header flying on different layers. As I stated in an [earlier post](http://www.kremalicious.com/2008/03/love-the-parallax/) there is already some usage for it around the web while this effect seems to be first used by the guys from [Silverback](http://www.silverbackapp.com/). If you don't know what this effect is about head over to [thinkvitamin](http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/design/how-to-recreate-silverbacks-parallax/trackback/) to get to know what it is and how you can achieve it.

But now Marco Kuiper from [marcofolio.net](http://www.marcofolio.net) adds another usage for it. He created a cool optical illusion with just plain css/html and some pictures. You can see a [demo of this effect](http://demo.marcofolio.net/a_parallax_illusion_with_css/) in action on Marco's website. Head over to the demo and resize your browser window. You should articulate something like "whoooot!" now. Marco has written [some words about it](http://www.marcofolio.net/css/a_parallax_illusion_with_css_the_horse_in_motion.html) too and you can download the demo. He has also [done a nice tutorial](http://www.marcofolio.net/photoshop/your_own_css_parallax_illusion_3d_image.html) how to achieve this optical illusion. Very cool!
