![image](/media/aperture-plugin128.png)Earlier this month [PictureCode](http://www.picturecode.com) finally released their noise reduction software [Noise Ninja](http://www.picturecode.com/media.htm) as an Aperture plug-in for Aperture 2.1 and above.

The results are just as amazing as they are with the Photoshop plug-in. But the Aperture plug-in uses a streamlined interface which differs from the photoshop version. But the functionality is the same.

You can [download a trial version of Noise Ninja for Aperture](http://www.picturecode.com/nn_aperture.htm) (images are watermarked with a grid pattern when you save them) and give it a try. The Noise Ninja plug-in for Aperture is available as a part of the [Pro Bundle (US$ 79.95)](http://www.picturecode.com/purchase.php) which includes the Photoshop and the Aperture plug-in. If you have an existing Pro Bundle license you can [upgrade it for US$ 20](http://www.picturecode.com/upgrade.php) to include the Aperture plug-in license.

Interested in more Aperture plug-ins? Just have a look at my article [First overview: Aperture 2.1 adjustment plugins have arrived](http://www.kremalicious.com/2008/05/first-aperture-adjustment-plugins-have-arrived/) to get an overview about what's available at the moment or [browse my blog by the Aperture plug-in tag](http://www.kremalicious.com/tag/aperture-plug-in/). Additionally you can have a look at the [brand new Apple website for all the Aperture plug-ins and ressources](http://www.apple.com/aperture/resources/plugins.html).
