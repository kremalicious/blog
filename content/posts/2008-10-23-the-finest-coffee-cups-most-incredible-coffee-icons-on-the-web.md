In this article I present you the finest icons of the fuel of a lot of designers and students (and other people too) available on the web. I've just released [my own coffee cup icon](/coffee-cup-icon) but this beverage seem to have inspired a lot of other beautiful icons especially for Mac OS X.

Now just get your next coffee, sit back and enjoy this little showcase. Just click on the images to get to the icon sources. At the end of the article you'll find links to some nice high quality coffee tutorials. And remember you will have more control over time itself if you [reach your 100th cup of coffee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Hundred_Big_Boys).

## Coffee Cup Icon by kremalicious


In a fit of megalomania I declared my icon as incredible and included it here. Originally I've made the coffee cup for the donations button on kremalicious.com.

## Kaffe! icon from World of Aqua 3 icon set by Dave Brasgalla


Coffee in a metal cup. Sadly Dave didn't updated his World of Aqua icon pack with bigger sizes so it's just 128px.

## Starbucks coffee icon by Rok Benedik

## Coffee folders from the Maji sets by Jonas Rask


Also Jonas used coffee as the metaphor for the work folder (supposedly) and made clear he likes very big coffee cups.

## Espresso icon by MacRabbit


Does this application need any introduction? Although not released yet the new web-coding application from MacRabbit drew a lot of attention. The icon is one of the reasons for that.

## Coffee folders from the Pry system sets by Jonas Rask


Another folder-combined-with-coffee icon by Jonas.

## Coffee icons from Office Space icon set by VisualPharm


A glass coffee cup which is [wildly used](http://abduzeedo.com/amazing-photoshop-light-effect-10-steps) on the web. Created for Windows so the icons are just 256px in size.

## Coffee Wallpaper by Michael Flarup


Not an icon but the coffee cup drawn in this wallpaper from Michael Flarup would make a good one. The detail of the cup is stunning.

Bean is a free word processor for Mac OS X and Laurent Baumann included a nice coffee cup in the application icon for it.

## Have A Break icons by mat-u


Nice shiny coffee cups with a lot of detail in the reflections. Sadly just in 128px size maximum. Maybe you can [persuade mat-u to update this icon with bigger sizes.](http://www.mat-u.com/)

## Caffeine icon by Trevor Kay


Trevor Kay made the new icon for Caffeine. This application prevents your Mac from automatically going to sleep. Trevor also made [some additional icons for Caffeine](http://God-X.deviantart.com/art/Caffeine-Replacement-Icons-75619389) although the coffee cup looks pretty much the same as the one from Apple's Java application icons.

## Coffee and Tea icons by Kate England


Some comic style icons which deviate from the realism of all the other coffee icons. Sadly just available in 128px size.
