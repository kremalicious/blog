I have added my first wallpaper to the Goodies section on this website. It's a shot of blooming chives which was altered with Aperture 2.1 and Photoshop CS3.

You can get the wallpaper by browsing [my Goodies section](http://www.kremalicious.com/goodies/) and clicking on the download link for the wallpaper. The download package also includes a custom folder icon (512px as .icns, .png, .ico) with the Chives wallpaper on it.

Beside that, this image is [available for print on deviantArt in various sizes](http://www.deviantart.com/print/3347544/).
