Good overview about the patterns currently being discussed:

> Recently, all of the ongoing discussion around responsive images just got real: a solution is currently being discussed with the WHATWG. And we’re in the thick of it now: we’re throwing around references to `picture` and `img set`; [...]

The markup pattern that gets selected stands to have a tremendous influence on how developers build websites in the future. Not just responsive or adaptive websites, either. All websites.

Naturally I'm in the `picture` camp, this just makes most sense to me.
