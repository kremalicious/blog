So, what to do when [everyone seem](http://www.littleboxofideas.com/blog/design-resources/5-very-useful-free-ipad-icon-sets-for-designers) [to release iPad icons](http://line25.com/articles/free-apple-ipad-icon-set-for-your-website-designs) but fail to include some crisp small size icons? Pushing the pixels for yourself of course. So here's my take on the smaller sizes of an [Apple iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad/) icon, called iPixelPad in the sizes 48px, 32px and 16px. Everything drawn pixel-perfect from scratch. Heck, even the wallpaper.

They also come in two different versions for each size: with a matte highlight shine and with a harder gloss.

And drawing the homescreen icons was quite funky and if you know the standard iPhone icons I bet you can guess what icons you can see here and in the icon files, at least in the 48px and 32px versions:

The homescreen icons pixels in the 16px version needed all more vivid colors to get them distinguishable from the wallpaper background so they're a bit different from the other sizes. These are the times I wish I could modify just half a pixel.
