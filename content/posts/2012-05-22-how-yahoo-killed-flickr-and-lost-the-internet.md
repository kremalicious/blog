Great insight article into what and how exactly Yahoo managed to screw this up.

> It is a case study of what can go wrong when a nimble, innovative startup gets gobbled up by a behemoth that doesn't share its values. What happened to Flickr? The same thing that happened to so many other nimble, innovative startups who sold out for dollars and bandwidth: Yahoo.

As a year long Flickr user I'm just sad about this but hey, we got [500px](http://500px.com/kremalicious) which probably wouldn't exist without Flickr's decline.
