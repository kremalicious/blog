Today [Human Software](http://www.humansoftware.com) released an exciting image editing plug-in for Apple's Aperture. It's called [ApertureEdit](http://www.humansoftware.com/pages1200/ApertureEdit/HSapertureedit11.html) and according to Human Software it offers more than 4000 professional effects which you can achieve right within Aperture.

The ApertureEdit plug-in is a bundle of 11 different modules for denoising, lens fixing, framing, light effects and many more. All effects can be applied to one image at a time or to a whole set of images at once. Just head over to the [product page](http://www.humansoftware.com/pages1200/ApertureEdit/HSapertureedit11.html) to see all effects and features this plugin bundle is capable of.

The whole bundle will cost you US$ 299.95 and it's available now [from Human Software's Online Shop](http://shareit1.element5.com/programs.html?productid=300256595&languageid=1&cart=1&cookies=1). But you can buy just one single plug-in too which will cost you US$ 69.95 for each. There's a [trial version](http://www.humansoftware.com/pages1200/ApertureEdit/HSapertureedit_trial.html) available too and if you don't want to mail Human Software for the trial version you can download it from [MacUpdate](http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/27639/apertureedit).
