![Digital Rebel XS/EOS 1000D ](../media/canon1000d.png)After the latest Digital Photo Professional update (DPP 3.4.1.1) [revealed some evidence about an upcoming Canon EOS Rebel XS/1000D](http://www.bobatkins.com/photography/digital/canon_xs_1000D_dpp34.html), Canon finally introduced this new entry-level DSLR this month. The [EOS Digital Rebel XS/1000D/Kiss F](http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_SLR/EOS_1000D/index.asp) ([full product specifications](http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_SLR/EOS_1000D/index.asp?specs=1)) is technically a hybrid between hardware and features found in Canon's entry-level cameras from the past: the 7-point autofocus system comes from the XT/350D, the Digic III processor is the same as in the XSi/450D and the Live View feature is implemented with the same features as found in the XSi/450D.

With this DSLR Canon seems to open up a new class in their EOS system which is somehow below the former entry level cameras (XT/350D, XTi/400D) and the latest entry-level XSi/450D. It's priced 200\$ below Canons current or former entry-level DSLR XSi/450D and you can find a nice first review of this new DSLR [over at Digital Photography Review](http://www.dpreview.com/previews/Canon_1000D/).

[![Speedlite 430EX II](../media/speedlite430exii.jpg)](../media/speedlite430exii.jpg)Canon also introduced the new midrange Speedlite 430EX II, replacing the 430EX flash unit. This new Speedlite is now fully configurable with the Camera's LCD menu and it got now a metal shoe. According to [Canon](http://www.canon.co.uk/press_centre/press_releases/cameras_accessories/speedlite_430ex_ii_press_release.asp) the 430EX II also boasts 20% faster recycling times and is more silent while doing this. In Europe and in the USA the Speedlite should be available from the end of July.
