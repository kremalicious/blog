They won't stop with their cutting edge love. After having [text-shadow](http://www.kremalicious.com/2008/04/make-cool-and-clever-text-effects-with-css-text-shadow/) implemented since many years and having a bunch of other cool stuff implemented like CSS gradients or CSS box-shadow the WebKit team freshly announced a new cool feature: CSS alpha masks.

From the Surfin' Safari Blog:

> WebKit now supports alpha masks in CSS. Masks allow you to overlay the content of a box with a pattern that can be used to knock out portions of that box in the final display. In other words, you can clip to complex shapes based off the alpha of an image.

It even can be applied to a video-element.
