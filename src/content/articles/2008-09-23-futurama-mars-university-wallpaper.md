Show your geeky love for extraterrestrial universities! This is a simple Futurama tribute wallpaper displaying the logo of the Mars University as seen in the first season (1ACV11/S02E02). But I've modified it a bit to get it out of the 2D. Including one high-resolution desktop version for widescreen displays (2560x1600) and one iPhone version (320x480).

As usual you can [grab the whole zip package from my Goodies page](http://www.kremalicious.com/goodies/#wall) and have fun.
