[![EOS 50D back](../media/eos_50D_front_thumb.png)](../media/eos_50D_front.png)The successor of the EOS 40D is (almost) here: Canon [officially announced](http://www.usa.canon.com/templatedata/pressrelease/20080826_eos50d.html) the Canon EOS 50D along with the new lens Canon EF-S 18-200/3.5-5.6IS. The EOS 50D and the new lens will be both available in October 2008, Canon says.

The EOS 50D comes with an CMOS APS-C sized sensor (crop factor 1.6) with 15.1 megapixels. Being Canons first DSLR with the new DIGIC 4 image processor the EOS 50D can burst 6.3 shots per second with improved image quality.

The "EOS Integrated Cleaning Systems" gets a new fluorine layer and now works in three steps to clean the sensor. With 35 metering zones and 9 cross type Autofocus zones the Autofocus specifications are the same as found in the EOS 40D.

[![EOS 50D back](../media/eos_50D_back_thumb.png)](../media/eos_50D_back.png)The basic ISO range goes from 100 - 3200 while those values can be "boosted" to ISO 6400 and 12800. The integrated noise reduction can be adjusted in four grades. The LCD display is now 3 inches big with 920,000 pixels (VGA) with a Live View Mode.

The EOS 50D is prized at US$1399 (1299€) for just the body and it will be available as a kit with the EF 28-135 3.5-5.6 IS USM for US$1599.

If you're interested in all the details and specifications have a look at [Bob Atkins article about the official announcement of the EOS 50D](http://www.bobatkins.com/photography/digital/canon_eos_50D.html).

[![EF-S 18-200/3.5-5.6 IS](../media/efs_18-200_thumb.png)](../media/efs_18-200.png)Along with the EOS 50D Canon announced the EF-S 18-200 3.5-5.6 IS as a new lens. The lens is intended for use with an APS-C sized sensor and insists of 16 elements (UD-glass and aspherical lenses) arranged in 12 groups. As the name says the EF-S 18-200 3.5-5.6 IS comes with an image stabilizer but somehow misses an USM ring motor which is quite strange for a lens of a prize of US\$699 (599€).

All the specifications for this new lens are available in [an article by Bob Atkins](http://www.bobatkins.com/photography/reviews/canon_efs_18-200_is.html) too.
