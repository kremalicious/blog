The Futurama episode [Attack of the Killer App](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_of_the_Killer_App) mocked a phone and a company you probably all have heard of. I've made some wallpapers with the logo of MomCorp presented everywhere in this episode.

The wallpaper comes in four versions with two color variations and two text variations with Mom's favorite tagline. Here's an overview:
