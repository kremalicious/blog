Here's a new desktop goodie for your pleasure. It's a replacement dock icon for the popular Mac IM client [Adium](http://adium.im/) following the style of atebit's excellent [Tweetie for Mac](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/) icon.

While the Tweetie Mac icon (and it's UI) was discussed quite controversial (which caused some very nice Tweetie replacement icons to appear, like [here](http://jonasraskdesign.com/medias/medias.html), [here](http://iconblock.deviantart.com/art/Tweetie-Mix-120360482), [here](http://macthemes2.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=16795744) or [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcelomarfil/3611311439/)), I grew to like the style of it. But Adium beside Tweetie in the Dock just looked weird... (No offense, [Adam](http://www.artofadambetts.com/weblog/?p=108)) So I redrew the whole icon and used Adium's duck silhouette on it and made some obvious and subtle changes in comparison to the Tweetie icon. And thanks to [Loren](http://blog.atebits.com/) who kind of rubber-stamped this icon release.

The icon comes in various formats (iContainer, icns, png) in sizes from 512px-16px and as an Adium dock icon package. This icon package uses some more icons (just 128px each) for the different states of Adium (online, offline, alert etc.) and includes the application icon too.

## Adium Icon Usage

![Adiumeetie Dock Preview](../media/Adiumeetie-Dock-Preview.png)Just double click the Adiumeetie.AdiumIcon file and the dock icon gets installed automatically. Then you can select the icon in Adium's preferences under Appearance > Dock Icon from the drop-down menu. After this the icon should be ready as your new Adium icon both in the Dock and in your Applications folder.

The icon is free for your personal use and I hope you'll enjoy it. If you do, don't forget to [spread the word via Twitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=Adiumeetie%3A%20Tweetie%20Style%20Adium%20Dock%20Icon%20from%20%40kremalicious%20http://kremalicious.com/adiumeetie/) and all your other favorite social media sites.

Oh, and for best look and karma you should [buy a license for Tweetie](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/buy/) right away.
