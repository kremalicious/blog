The [Gare do Oriente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare_do_Oriente) in Lisbon, Portugal. Always a pleasure arriving at this train station and looking at [Santiago Calatrava's](https://calatrava.com) work, who also reconstructed the [Oberbaum Bridge](https://calatrava.com/projects/oberbaum-bridge-berlin.html) in Berlin, Germany.
