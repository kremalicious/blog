Was one of the people interviewed by Charmaine Li from VentureVillage about relaunching a startup's website where I talk a bit about [ezeep's relaunch](https://www.ezeep.com/blog/hip-hip-have-a-look-at-ezeeps-hot-new-home-page/).

In there, Christian Hanke from Edenspiekermann makes a good point. A web site is so much more than just a showcase of products:

> In the early stages, entrepreneurs are likely to be more focused on building and refining a product rather than developing a brand identity. But as a startup begins to scale, taking a longer-term brand approach – which involves thinking in broader terms than just the product itself – is an important part of enabling product extensions and expansion to new markets, says Hanke.
