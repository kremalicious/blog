![Aperture](/media/aperture128.png)Have you ever looked for a way to quickly add text to your images [without photoshopping a watermark image](http://www.kremalicious.com/2008/05/high-quality-watermarks-with-aperture/) first?

There's a simple editing plug-in available for this task called [Borders & Titles](http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/BordersAndTitles/index.html) and as the name says you can add simple borders and text to your images within Aperture 2.1. It's a sample plug-in provided by Apple and it's fully functional. You can download it from Apple's Developer Connection website without registration:

[Aperture Edit Plugin - Borders & Titles](http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/BordersAndTitles/index.html)

The downlaod package includes the source code too so you can adjust the plug-in if you're able to code Cocoa. After downloading put the BordersAndTitles.ApertureEdit plug-in into /Library/Application Support/Aperture/Plug-Ins and access the plug-in from Aperture.
