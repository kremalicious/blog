[![Fisheye-Hemi](/media/imagetrends_hemi_10.jpg)](/media/imagetrends_hemi_10.jpg)Today Image Trends Inc. [announced](http://www.imagetrendsinc.com/news/Aperture%20Fisheye%20Hemi%20%20Final.pdf) the final availability of the anti-distortion plugin [Fisheye-Hemi](http://www.imagetrendsinc.com/products/prodpage_hemi.asp) as an editing plugin for Aperture 2.1. The plugin will remap your hemispheric images taken with a fisheye lens. So if you take pictures with a fisheye lens this plugin is a must have for you.

From the press release:


> Photographers can now easily preserve a normal view of people by not distorting their faces and bodies, as the plug-in straightens vertical lines. Fisheye-Hemi Plug-In uses almost all of the pixel data in that view with no loss of image resolution while displaying the intended composition and framing better than other un-warping programs. 



If you're interested in how the plugin works there's [a cool in-depth explanation from the guys at Image Trends on their website](http://www.imagetrendsinc.com/products/specpage_hemi.asp).

The Fisheye-Hemi plugin is the first plugin from Image Trends coming for Apple's Aperture. Image Trends' president and CEO Dan Sullivan says that the other plugins [PearlyWhite](http://www.imagetrendsinc.com/products/prodpage_pearly.asp) and [ShineOff](http://www.imagetrendsinc.com/products/prodpage_shine.asp) are expected to be released within the next 60 days while some mysterious "other products" will follow them too. The plugin costs US$ 29.95 and if you want the plugin for Aperture and Photoshop you get a 50% discount. There's also a free trial version of the plugin available.
